        <p>My name is Monica Coley. I am currently enrolled in Lambda School's Web Development Program. 
            My main goal is to obtain a job where I can expand my knowledge and creativity skills.
            I also have a dream of owning my own web design firm where I can provide free internship to aid 
            other college students in getting their feet in the door with work experience.</p>
