      <h3> Creativity<h3>
    </li>
    As an aspiring artist and crafting enthusiast, with an eye for detail, I can see myself enjoyably contributing
    to different roles in the development field. While I gain skills as a developer, I plan to practice those skills
    as I create a website for my side start-up business. I have been using Facebook for displaying the products, but
    as I expand my business, I would like to create my own website.
    <li>
      <h3> Flexibility </h3>
    </li>
    I'm attracted to the options of working from home, in an office, or while traveling. While life can be
    unpredictable, I believe there will always be tech positions available that I can obtain no matter where I am as
    long as I have the motivation and desire.
    <li>
      <h3>Skills, Qualities, and Interests</h3>
    </li>
    Naturally, I have a love for learning and challenges. My interests and skills in puzzles, math, problem solving,
    writing, and organization seem to align nicely in the world of Web Development.
