    <h1> About </h1>
<p>I am currently enrolled in the PT Web Development with Lambda. I graduated from Boise State Universtiy in December of 2018 with a B.S. in Criminal Justice. I chose to further my education with Lambda because the career paths in Criminal Justice do not match with my personality. With Lambda, I hope my future will be a brighter one.</p>
