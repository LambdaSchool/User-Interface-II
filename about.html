            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Born in the Philippines but raised in the heart of Jersey City, I've been exposed to different cultures and pursued a variety of hobbies. Somewhere along the line I developed a passion for computers and decided to make a living from it. I'm an avid believer that you could never stop learning. It shows in the way I approach new problems and tasks. I'm always willing to tackle any challenge  only fearing I don't learn from the experience.</p>
