    <p>I'm a 38 year old aspiring web developer from Tulsa Oklahoma learning HTML and CSS. I have a corgi name Tyrion who is named after one of the characters from the Game of Thrones books and show.
        I love playing video games and listening to podcast with interneting people or dumb fun topics like when someone ask
        "Do you want a burger" in you mind is there cheese on that burger without question? It's imporant topics like this that keep world interesting.
