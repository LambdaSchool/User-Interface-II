    <h1> About David Spear</h1>

        <p>I am a new programming student who is attending Lambda School. I am currently building up 
        my portfolio and don't have too many projects under my belt. So far I have completed a small web page 
        involving CSS and HTMl. More CSS and HMTL projects are on the way and eventually I will begin Javascript 
        projects as well. I will update my portfolio as I finish more projects. If you are interested in my work you
        can click the contact button on my main portfolio page to get in touch.
            </p>
