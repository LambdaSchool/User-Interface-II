                <p>I was born and raised in Connecticut. I grew up playing sports and going out exploring everywhere I could.</p>

                <p>School has always been easy for me. From Kindergarten - 8th I went to The Independent Day School. My High School Xavier, would pave the way for my acceptance into Harvard University. I am now enrolled at Lambda getting ready to get working somewhere with good people at a good company.</p>

                <p>My first legal-age job was pouring foundations for houses on the beach. I've worked my way around the construction site through the years, learning from the ground up how to build structures. I started landscaping because I was ready to be outside more and to learn more things. I've always been into computers; I still remember my first Gateway2000... It was in pieces before the weekend, but back up and running by Monday morning!</p>
