    <h1> ABOUT </h1>

    <p> My name is Chris Ramirez and I am 26 years old. I was born in New Jersey and have lived here my entire life. <br>
        Being that NJ is not the most beautiful of states, I have tried to travel as much as possible. <br>
        Upon getting older I fell in love with hiking and exploring the beautiful landscapes of our planet. <br>
        I have been fortunate to be able to travel with my family and friends and I am excited to go on my next journey. <br>
    </p> <br>

    <p> Outside of traveling I obsessively listen to music. I do my best to explore a lot of different genres,<br>
        but find myself gravitating towards funk, RnB, and rap music (though I guess most genres have fused together nowaadays.)
