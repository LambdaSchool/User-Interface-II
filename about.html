    <h1 id="abouthead">ABOUT US</h1>
    <h2 id="aboutwords">Jacob Bevans believes in protecting our environment through cleaner manufacturing processes. Our goal is sustainability; not only to better our environment today but for generations to come. At Design To Print, we have been diligently working on environmental sustainability. Recycling plays a major role in our day to day production. We develop and manufacture our own SEG beading made from recycled materials - that can be fully recycled again. We print on the finest biodegradable vinyls and fabrics, along with integrated company wide recycling programs and hybrid vehicle operations. Click to read more about our Green Initiative.</h2>
