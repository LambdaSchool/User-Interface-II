    <h1> About Me </h1>
    
    <p>
        I have been highly involved in technical spaces since I was in 9th Grade.  
      
        


    </p>
    <p>
        Ever since the first day of walking into the shop floor of my high school robotics team,
        I have developed a strong passion and ambition into honing my skills in technical fields. 
       
    </p>
    <p>
        As a graduate from Purdue University and Lambda coding school, 
        I aim to provide high quality technical services to clients.
        My freelance services include web development, custom 3D printing, and freelance 3D modeling. 

    </p>

    <p>
        I also have a small registered LLC where I sell 3D printed products.
