    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p>Hi!
        I'm a country girl at heart, a wife, and a mom! I got into coding quite by accident, but am totally enjoying it!
        I honestly never thought I'd go back to school. I was content being a stay-at-home mom and wife. Then due to circumstances
        beyond my control, suddenly my life was going an entirely different direction. Once I settled into my new life a little,
        I decided I should probably look at seeing if there was a career out there that I could do, and still homeschool my children.
        I fell into Web development quite by accident, as I said above, but I am discovering that it's actually something I seem
        to have some ability at!
    </p>
