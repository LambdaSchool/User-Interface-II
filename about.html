<section>   
<p> Hello! My name is Austin Littlefield, I am 24, I live in Las Vegas, NV and I am just starting to learn coding! Currently I work as a steel estimator so coding is brand new to me. I have lived in Las Vegas since I was a little kid and love to call it home. I am enganged and hoping to get married next spring. I am into rock climbing, camping and hiking (pretty much anything that gets me out of the heat.) Finally, I am excited to start on my coding journey and see where it takes me! </p>
