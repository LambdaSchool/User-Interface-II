        <p>My name is Austin Jansen, I am currently 26 years old and I live in Georgia. I started my journey programming in an unconventional way. I began by reading books. Well, not really reading more like obsesively pouring over the multitude of text books I purchased. I am sure the question may arise of why did I begin my learning this way?Well, in the spirit of transperancy I made a bad decision some years ago and got myself a prison sentence. Once there, I realized I am not that kind of person. I changed my life drastically. I spent my time reading and educating myself. I can't count the number of books that I read in the five year period I was incarcerated. I studied many different subjects; Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Advanced Mathematics, and even various religions. This wasn't the only thing that I changed, however. I knew that for me to make a lasting personality change I needed to all but become a different person. I knew that I had much unused potential, but I couldn't realize it until I buckled down and did the work. I changed my vocabulary, I began to watch different types of television shows, I took it upon myself to truly alter the way I thought. It was hard at first, having to make a conscience effort to shift my thoughts. Gradually it become easier and easier. I am not perfect, not by a long shot. The progress I am making, however, brings me much joy, and every small win I have motivates me to continue. </p>

        <h2>What I Do...</h2>
            <hr class="solid"></hr>
        <p>These days I spend my time studying, coding, enjoying the company of my family, and brainstorming ideas to turn into projects. I have been able to put coding into practice for about five months now. It took some time for me to adjust to actually put what I have learned into practice. There were some days of discouragement, but I always pulled through. I pride myself on my persistance and dedication. I love Computer Science and everything that goes with it. I find it fascinating and challenging. I have many goals that I plan to accomplish. I know that it won't be easy, but that is the bliss of it. Overcoming challenges is a strength of mine. To me there is no better feeling than solving a puzzle; whatever that puzzle may look like. I am beginning my freelance journey as well. Building quality websites and assisting with resolving bugs in other's websites and/or programs. This is a passion of mine, so my price to build is definitely affordable. I would love any job I can get, it means experience and the better I am able to provide for my family. If you have any qustions you would like to have answered or would like to hire me for a project, or give me any advice, you can contact me through the <a href="contact.php">contact page.</a> </p>

            <h2>My Qualifications...</h2>
            <hr class="solid"></hr>
            <p>In terms of my qualifications, I know a few different programming languages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>PHP</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
            As I said before, my practical expereince may not be long term yet but, I make up for it with my intuitiveness and dedication. I am currently attending Lambda for more experience in programming. I have also taken on projects for myself. I have recently taken it upon myself to fully dedicate myself to advancing my knowledge and experience. I started out learning Java. I mastered the foundations of it in a very unconventional way. I learned from books such as Herb Shildts, Beginners Guide to Java, and his Complete Reference, all without access to a computer. I would spend time learning the structure and the rules, write out code on paper, send it to my Dad for compiling and testing, then if there were any errors, he would send the source code back and I would go through it until I fixed it. I held a job as a database assistant manager at Hightower Garment Factory, where I kept track of "employees" and built queries to optimize certain functions with SQL. I am a come in early and stay late kind of guy. I strive to better myself everyday, and learn all I can each day.

        <div class="Why">
            <h2>My Why...</h2>
            <hr class="solid"></hr>
            <p>Ultimately, my goal is to provide a blessed life for my family and ascend to a point where I can do more to help my community. I understand the hardships many face that are often hard to overcome. Where many times these are due to choices made in the past. I don't encourage not taking responsibility, that is very important. What is also important is to give people the chance to redeem themselves; to achieve their potential. Unfortunately, this is oftentimes harder due to past relations with family. It is never intentional, more than likely it isn't even recognized. I myself have been in many confusing situations, having goals myself and getting torn between striving for them or helping elsewhere. I enjoyed helping of course, but there comes a time when one needs to be able to give their all to their passions. I have met many people who could be in a much different place, if given that chance. If a person makes a mistake, but works to better themselves and strive for something greater, than we as a people should do whatever it takes to encourage that. It doesn't always mean financialy, it could be anything. The best thing I received has been words of encouragement and being treated as the man I am today, not my past. So why do I do what I do... I do it for myself, my family, and because the only way to make a true impact on the world is to better yourself and lead by example.   </p>
