    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p>I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross
        browser compatible, and performant.</p>
    <p>I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best and most
        appropriate experience suited to their device and browser.</p>
    <p>I take great pride in not only being able to complete work to the high standard you expect but also go the extra
        mile wherever possible. I enjoy getting to know a business, its goals, and how I can best apply myself to make
        sure your website succeeds. For established clients, I particularly like analysing their metrics and making
        data-based decisions and recommendations, leading to better rates of success.</p>
