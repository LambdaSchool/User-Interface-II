            <p>Lambda school has been quite a journey. I was very overwhelmed with a lot of information on the orientation and the first day following orientation day, espesially when it comes to using so many platforms and channels. As days go by i was getting familiar with them. Although i found html and css very overwhelming at first, now with a help of css flex-box i am getting the hang of it.</p>
