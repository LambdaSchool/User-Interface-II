	<p>Hi, my name is Dylan and honestly there's not alot about me. I'm a shut-in and don't really have plans to change that; always had an interest in code but never tried until now. <br> <br>I also want to get into the development field so I can find a job that allows me to make money from the comfort of my home without having to go out into the public too often.</p>
