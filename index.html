        <p> Stan Tudor loves programming, writing, speaking, traveling, and lifting heavy things. He does not
            love talking about himself. Previously, he spent more than a decade building infrastructure and products
            that served users while working as a software engineer at TripAdvisor,
            Cisco Systems, and Thomson Financial. For more info, check out his projects.
