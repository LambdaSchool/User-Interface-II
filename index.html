        <h2>Introducing My Site!</h2>
            <p>I have me head in the clouds and my feet on the ground. I think globally, live locally.
                I am from the South, but my true home is the Pacific Northwest. I have driven across
                the country twice - once just me and my black cat, Juju. I love working with my hands
                and climbing trees as much as I love glitter and romance. I look forward to leveraging
                a tech career to help shelter animals and lonely people connect.
