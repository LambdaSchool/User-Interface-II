                 <p>When I look at where I am today, I see<br>
                a girl who has worked hard to get where she is.<br>
            I see a girl who has lived in multiple country and study their ways of life <br>
        while proudly representing her country.<br>
            But most of all, I see a woman, who is going to be earning<br>
        more then her "pilot" husband, once she is finished Lambda, and<br>
        and has achieved all that is required of her and more.</p>
