        <p>
          For all of my life, I've been a tinkerer. And a passionate one at
          that. This aspect of my life is what ultimately led me to a career in
          web development. In my past lives, I have been an oil painter, a
          musician, a writer, a designer, and a dabbler of many, many things.
          Web development allows me to use my creativity to it's fullest
          potential and allows me to provide each of my clients with highly
          stylized, full functioning web sites that convert. Thank you for
          browsing through my projects!
