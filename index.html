        <h1 class='title'>Full Stack Web developer</h1>
        <p class='intro'>My name is Juan Ordonez, I'm an aspiring full stack web developer! I have always had a
            hybrid of both creative and technical interests. I worked several years in the film
            industry as a Camera operator where I naturally applied both sets of skills to shape and create a directors
            vision with the tools
            of lighting, composition, camera placement, and a daring mentality to never settle.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">I am currently a student at the Lambda Full Web Bootcamp, learning and improving rapidly
            everyday through team based projects, industry standard design, and problem
            solving situations.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            I am applying everything I've taken away from those projects and seek to provide the same quality
            content for clients
            looking to make their presence on the web be known boldly and elequently. Below are several projects that
            showcase these skills in a variety of ways.
