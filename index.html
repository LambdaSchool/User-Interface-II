     <h4>COVID-19</h4>
     <p class='text1'> 
     A couple of months ago my mom started having flu like symptoms. I would tell her go get tested. As always, she wouldnt listen. 
     </p>
     <p class='text2'>     
     She tested positive for that "RONA". Two days so did I. Needless to say, my neice, CJ, & her son, Jayden, were ushered out to a motel. Till then that boy was one & only reason to maintain.

     My mom is at a hotel. I was at a hotel. There was an electrical fire in our bathroom on the 4th of July. Ive been trying my best just to keep it together. Truth is I dont know how. I cry a little every now & then. Seems to help.
