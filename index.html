<h2>This is where all the magic happens.</h2>
Welcome to my page that is all about my projects that I have completed. As I take the journey down the path to learn the art of coding and web page design
I would like to have a place to share my accomplishments, some will be better then others, but they are all important steps in the process of learning and growing
as a person and as a software developer. Please take a look around and feel free to check out any of the links provided and check out the evolution of my learning for 
yourself.
