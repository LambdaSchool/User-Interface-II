        <p> i originally tried join lambda at the beginning of the year. 
            unfortunately had a mountain biking accident and shattered my collar bone. 
            i was able to start finally in august. 
            i did not have the greatest start 
            and quickly fell behind due to a death in the family from covid,
             luckily lambda was really understanding and i was able to flex.
            i met some great people in my first attemp through who have stayed to help me through my second,
        and have felt much better this go around. </p>
       </div>
