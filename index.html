    <h2>This is where all the magic happens</h2>
    
      <p>Welcome to my page that is all about my projects that I have completed. As I take the journey down the path to learn the art of coding and web page design.</p>
    
      <p>I would like to have a place to share my accomplishments, some will be better then others, but they are all important steps in the process of learning and growing
    as a person and as a software developer.</p> 
      
      <p>Please take a look around and feel free to check out any of the links provided and check out the evolution of my learning for yourself.</p>
