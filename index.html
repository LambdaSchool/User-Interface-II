              <h3>Bitcoin ATM locator</h3>
              <p>
                This was a fun project. I was trying to work with API's and
                decided to build a locator for the Bitcoin ATM's in my area. A
                lot of work went into this one but I am pleased with the overall
                result. This was my first time implementing and calling an API.
                To my surprise it was a lot easier that I thought it would be.
                this project allowed me to brush up on CSS and javascript. This
                project also implements both a moz scrollbar and a webkit
                scrollbar to hide the scrollbar.

              <h3>Guess The Number</h3>
              <p>
                This was my first Javascript Challenge. Coding this game really
                grounded my understanding of javascript. The game randomly
                generates a number from 1-100 and prompts the user to guess what
                it is. It then prompts the user wether their guess is too high,
                too low, or correct and stores their guess history. The user can
                reset the game at any time which causes the game to generate a
                new random number and clear the guess history. You can view the
                code I used for this project

              <h3>Coin News Network</h3>
              <p>
                This is my current website. I originally had it set up to be a
                news syndication site. It was originally scraping data from
                several different websites and publishing them via RSS, but I
                recently started publishing my own news content. It is built off
                of Wordpress. A LOT of work has been put into the look and feel
                of This website to get it to where it is now. This website
                really tested my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                Although it is built off of wordpress, almost everything is
                tweaked using CSS and javascript. <br />
