    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>    
    
   
     <p class="text-container">First and foremost, welcome! This is something way outside of my comfort zone and I am happy to give you a glimpse of the journey I am currently embarked on. 
        I've spent a number of years in the restaurant industry which I thought I would spend the rest of my life in. 
        With this whole pandemic though things have shifted in my life a little bit. It opened my eyes to how unsure restaurant work can be if somehting bad were to happen.
        In order to prevent that from happening again I'm endeavoring to learn full stack here at Lambda school. We're only just starting but it's tough already.
        I know it will be an uphill battle, but I am confident in my ability to thrive under pressure. I can't wait for the  "ah-ha" moment that i'm sure will be striking me.
