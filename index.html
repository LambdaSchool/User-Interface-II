       <h2>Welcome</h2>
       <p>My name is Donnie. I create with words, art, graphic design, and code.</p>
       <p>I am applying lifeâ€™s pressures to make sure I shine, and my top professional goal is to help others do the same. My diverse background in care-giving, management, and branding have fostered my collaboration skills and sharp eye, allowing them to blend with my natural desire to help others. My experience with building my own business has positioned me to aid clients and readers through the process with an unmatched level of care and focus on foundation, creating endless possibilities. There is space for everyone in this world to shine; I'm here to make sure you do as well.</p>
