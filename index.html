            <h2>Introducing My Site</h2>
            <p>I wanted this site to show my interest in dogs. I have been training and competing with dogs for almost 25 years.
            I have trained in a discipline known as Schutzhund. This is a German dogsport that tests the dogs ability to track a train, do obedience exercised, and prove the ability to protect its handler. I have trained all over the country with instructors from all over the world.  </p>
            <p>I takes many years of training to acheive the titles that are given to the team. The training is very fulfilling when you start with an 8 week old puppy and take them to national or internation trials. </p>
