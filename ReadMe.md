Task 1: Set up Project
New features of a project should occur in a new branch in the same repository. Follow these steps to set up and work on your project from Thursday:

 cd into your personal portfolio folder
 [x] Create a new branch from <firstName-lastName>:
    git checkout -b <firstName-lastName-day2>
 [x] Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName-day2> branch, committing changes regularly.
 [x] Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName-day2>.
Task 2: Minimum Viable Product
Use the checklist below to guide your work today. Your final product should be presentable at mobile, tablet and a desktop-width.

 [x] Insert a viewport meta tag into the head of the project with these html attributes: content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
 [x] Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px
 Add accessability features to your webpage
 Design should closely follow the mobile wireframe given for your chosen layout
Task 3: Stretch Goals
Once you finish the minimum viable project, work on any of the following stretch goals:

 Test your website at several breakpoints and refactor code as needed. A few common breakpoints are below:
 iPhone: 360√ó640
 Laptop: 1366√ó768
 Widescreen: 1920√ó1080
 Test your webpage's accessibility with a screen reader like this
 Start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like. I recommend making a branch of all your content in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate

FAQs
What if I'm not done with my site from last time?

*If you're not totally happy with your site, that's fine. Try to work with what you have.

My site works on mobile - does that count as responsive?

A mobile website is not the same thing as a responsive website! A responsive webpage works at any browser width, not just mobile. Keep on coding!
