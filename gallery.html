            Hello, I'm Jacob! I'm just a young guy with some dreams, so I'll be using this as my journal somewhat. A little about me, I've lived in a town called Saint George, Utah for most of my life.
            I've taking a few adventures out into the big world, lived in Las Vegas for about a year. I was working a solid 9 to 5 at a career I really enjoyed at the time, finally feeling as though I got this whole life thing down.
            But, there's always got to be a "but", there came COVID-19, mind you I was working as an events/tradeshow specific print and graphics company, so that left me dry in the dust. I know covid was a trajety for a lot of us, but we've got this!(;
            That brought me to my next adventure. If you've ever been a young adult, you've probably been told you can make 30k in just the summer if you came and sold some pest control! So I took a leap of faith and dove right on into it, not really knowing what else to do.
            Salt Lake City is where I ended up! It was an amazing place! I did alright selling pest control, I learned a ton of things and stuck with the grind most of the summer. Then I decided it was just me time.
            That's when I joined Full-Stack Web Development school with Lambda. It's been such great experience so far. I'm learning things I've always been curious how they were made, maintained, amd thought through, it has been addicting so far!
