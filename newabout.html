 <h2> My Coding Experience </h2>
  
  <p> I started with a degree in Game Design. I went to Hostos Community College which is located in Bronx, New York. <br>
  While attending my college I also took various electives and one of those included an Intro to Web Design course. <br>
  My college made graduating a bit difficult so when I finally recieved my first degree it was too late to enter a bachelors program. <br>
  I had a friend going through Lambda and he suggeseted I should attend as well, I figured it would be a good way to keep busy </p>
